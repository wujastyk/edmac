# EDMAC
The venerable EDMAC macros for formatting critical editions with Plain TeX.

This is version 3.17, from June 1996.

It was authored by John Lavagnino and Dominik Wujastyk, with help from many friends.  It is not maintained.  
 
EDMAC is a set of \PlainTeX\ macros providing the
ability to format critical editions of texts in the traditional
way, i.e., similar to the Oxford Classical Texts, Teubner, Arden
Shakespeare and other series. The principal functions that are
added are marginal line numbering and multiple series of
footnotes and endnotes keyed to line numbers. While {\tt EDMAC}'s
inner workings are necessarily esoteric, it seeks to provide
relatively simple macros to enable you to control the exact
format of the edition, taking into account the need to vary the
format for different sorts of texts.

EDMAC 3.17 still works just fine, and is a good choice for anyone comfortable with Plain TeX.

Meanwhile, EDMAC 3.16 was adapted in 1994 by Peter Wilson so that it could be conveniently loaded as a LaTeX package and take advantage of LaTeX features. This package was called LEDMAC (available on [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/ledmac)).

Later still, Maieul Rocquette worked on LEDMAC and produced an extended, updated LaTeX package called eLEDMAC ([CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/eledmac)).  Later still, eLEDMAC was frozen and its successor evolved into reLEDMAC ([CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/reledmac), [GitHub](https://github.com/maieul/ledmac)).

EDMAC is hosted here at GitHub, and also at the TeX Users Group, at http://tug.org/edmac.
