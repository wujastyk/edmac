# EDMAC
The venerable EDMAC macros for formatting critical editions with Plain TeX.

This is version 3.17, from June 1996.  This was the final release of the EDMAC package.

It was authored by John Lavagnino and Dominik Wujastyk, with help from many friends.  
After a long period of testing and refinement, it is now frozen and no longer maintained. 
But it still works well :-)
 
EDMAC is a set of Plain TeX macros providing the
ability to format critical editions of texts in the traditional
way, i.e., similar to the Oxford Classical Texts, Teubner, Arden
Shakespeare and other series. The principal functions that are
added are marginal line numbering and multiple series of
footnotes and endnotes keyed to line numbers. While EDMAC's
inner workings are necessarily esoteric, it provides
relatively simple macros to enable you to control the exact
format of your edition, taking into account the need to vary the
format for different sorts of texts.

EDMAC 3.17 still works just fine, and is a good choice for anyone comfortable with Plain TeX.

## Later history 

EDMAC 3.16 was forked in 1994 by Peter Wilson so that it could be conveniently loaded as a LaTeX package and take advantage of LaTeX features. This package was called LEDMAC (available on [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/ledmac)).

Later still, [Ma√Øeul Rouquette](https://github.com/maieul) worked on LEDMAC and produced an extended, updated LaTeX package called eLEDMAC ([CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/eledmac)).  After much development, eLEDMAC was frozen and its successor became reLEDMAC ([CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/reledmac), [GitHub](https://github.com/maieul/ledmac)), currently the most evolved and powerful version of this family of macro packages.

A bibliography of some of the editions produced with EDMAC, LEDMAC and reLEDMAC [is publicly available](https://www.zotero.org/groups/209265/critical_editions_typeset_with_edmac_ledmac_eledmac_and_reledmac/library).

## The published manual

In 1996, the [UK TeX Users Group](http://uk.tug.org/) and the (international) [TeX Users Group](http://tug.org) jointly published the EDMAC manual and code as a physical book ([Worldcat entry](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38058109)). John and I are grateful to the late Sebastian Rahtz for the work he did in bringing this about and in formatting the book nicely for print.

EDMAC is hosted here at GitHub, and also at the TeX Users Group, at http://tug.org/edmac.
